# Bananna-Host
This is a very incomplete attempt at extending https://github.com/Gerharddc/RepRap-Phone-Host in order to become a cross platform application. No guarentees that it will even compile but there might be some interesting code.

The slicer core in this project is more advanced than the one in RepRap-Phone-Host but less integrated.

There are different applications in this project which share some common code that can be found in the shared folders.

An attempt has been made to implement the 3D rendering part in ThreeJS which means that the 3D part runs inside a webview and then communicates with the C# code which functions as a web server.

Oh and yes, there is a typo in the name just to keep things intereseting :)
